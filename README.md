# Personal Portfolio
Hello! My name is Noah Proctor and I am a sophomore at Columbia University studying Environmental Engineering and CS. I'm looking to combine my passions for CS and sustainability, whether through data analysis or SWE for the environment. 
This portfolio is one of my first projects, and I take great pride in it! It showcases my background in coding and beyond.
